# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **zhang.log** (313 symbols, 505 relationships, 9 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze --index-only` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? Bootstrap with `npx`, `bunx`, or `pnpm dlx` — e.g. `bunx gitnexus@latest analyze` (npm 11 npx crash; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact before editing.** Use `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs impact "symbolName" --direction upstream --repo .`; report callers, processes, and risk. Never substitute grep for graph analysis.
- **MUST analyze graph changes before committing.** Use `detect_changes({scope: "all"})` (MCP) or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs detect-changes --scope all --repo .` (CLI fallback). `partial: true` or `truncated: true` is not a clean check — a zero means unseen, not unaffected; re-run it. For regression review: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})` or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs detect-changes --scope compare --base-ref "main" --repo .`.
- MUST warn on HIGH/CRITICAL `risk` pre-edit; never use `riskSharedAxes` to waive a HIGH/CRITICAL `risk` warning. Compare File/symbol: MCP File omits axes; Graph-RAG expands File.
- **MUST treat `risk: UNKNOWN` as unresolved, not as low.** An empty caller set is not evidence the symbol is unused — it can also mean the callers are not resolvable by the index (plain-object property access, dynamic dispatch, cross-language calls). `impact` pairs `UNKNOWN` with a `riskNote` saying so. Confirm with a text search before treating the symbol as safe to change or delete; do not proceed on the strength of a zero.
- **MUST use `query({search_query: "concept"})` for concepts/flows, `context({name: "symbolName"})` for a named symbol, or `impact` for blast radius, on read-only callers, dependencies, imports, or execution flow.** Graph first; text search only for empty/`UNKNOWN`/literals.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method before MCP/CLI impact analysis.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis, and never read `UNKNOWN` as an all-clear — it means the walk could not answer, which is the one verdict that requires confirming by other means.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit before MCP/CLI graph change analysis.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# 小屏验收与 Chrome DevTools

- 使用 Chrome DevTools MCP 时，优先用开发者模式 / 设备模拟检查 DOM、计算样式、滚动触发和交互，不要只依赖缩放窗口或静态截图。
- 本站任何小屏 UI 变更，**至少**必须通过 Samsung Galaxy A55 `360×800`（DPR 2）验证，对应 emulation `360x800x2`；不能只用 390px 或缩放窗口代替。
- 必查项：无横向溢出（`scrollWidth ≤ 360`）、关键内容可见、滚动/入场动画正常、交互可点。
- 390、768 等尺寸作为补充，但 `360×800` 是硬性下限。
